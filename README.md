This project contains a fully semantic and accessible HTML5 form created as part of an HTML Forms Implementation assignment. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate proper use of semantic HTML structure, form elements, accessibility practices, and clear documentation.

## 📌 Project Description

The repository includes an HTML form designed using only semantic HTML elements—no CSS or JavaScript. The form showcases best practices for structure, labeling, grouping, and accessibility. Each section of the form is organized using semantic containers such as `<section>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<legend>`.

This project focuses on clarity, usability, and correct HTML5 form implementation.

## 📄 Form Purpose

The form is structured to collect:

- Basic personal information (name, email, phone number)
- Additional user details such as date of birth and communication preferences
- Optional comments or additional notes

The form is designed for demonstration purposes and does not submit data to a server (`action="#"` placeholder).
